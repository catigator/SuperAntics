GAME INSTRUCTIONS:
===================================================================

You are the green ant and the blue ants are out to get you. ry to survive as long as possible! You control your ant with the arrow keys. You can walk twice as fast when in already hollowed out tunnels compared to digging new ones. This means you will need to build tunnels strategically to survive; try to to lure the enemy ants to dig new tunnels while you use already dug ones. 

Your green ant is faster than the enemy ants, but if you have to dig new tunnels while they can follow in your footsteps you will die sooner rather than later.

You can change the speed of the game and the number of enemy ants in the intro screen.
