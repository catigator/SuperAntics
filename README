TO RUN:
===================================================================

Clone this repository or download it as a zip file and extract it.

Unrar the Install.rar file and run setup.exe. After you install it you can just run it from the Start menu. To uninstall, you need to go to the Control Panel and uninstall it from the Programs and Features list.

You can also check out the source code yourself. If you don't have Visual Studio for C# installed, download and install Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express for Windows Phone at http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express . This will install the XNA framework as well.

If you already have Visual Studio for C# installed you just need to install the XNA framework from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23714

Then you just need to open the SuperAntics.sln file in Visual Studio. You can press the "Play" button to play it in debug mode from Visual Studio, or publish the game and create an installion file from Visual Studio.

GAME INSTRUCTIONS:
===================================================================

You are the green ant and the blue ants are out to get you. Try to survive as long as possible! You control your ant with the arrow keys. You can walk twice as fast when in already hollowed out tunnels compared to digging new ones. This means you will need to build tunnels strategically to survive; try to to lure the enemy ants to dig new tunnels while you use already dug ones. 

Your green ant is faster than the enemy ants, but if you have to dig new tunnels while they can follow in your footsteps you will die sooner rather than later. You have two lives; if you touch and enemy ant you lose one life, and you die when you lose your second life. 

You can change the speed of the game and the number of enemy ants in the intro screen.
